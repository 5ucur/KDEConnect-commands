# KDE Connect-commands
This repository contains a list of commands to be used in KDE Connect.<br>
This list is a compilation of many sources that I found in internet, including KDE User Base Wiki and Reddit.<br>

KDE Connect is a nice way to control your Plasma Desktop from your Android phone. Have a lot of features as: Send files from and to phone, control slideshow presentation, control multimedia application, remote input and the ability to run commands directly in your Linux box.<br>

To use it, you have to install KDE Connect package on your distribution and the app in your Android phone.
The Android app can be found at [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.kde.kdeconnect_tp) and [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.kde.kdeconnect_tp/).<br>

In this little tutorial, I'll show how to do with Archlinux.<br>
>sudo pacman -S kdeconnect

The package have some optional depencdencies that you should install to be able to use the respective feature in KDE Connect.<br>
* sshfs: remote filesystem browser
* kde-cli-tools: configuration UI
* qt5-declarative: QML bindings
* python-nautilus: Nautilus integration

Feel free to contribute and make this list bigger and better.
